Command-line calculators and design checks for **metal stamping, deep drawing, progressive die work and sheet metal bending** — the same rules our DFM engineers apply every day at [Balford](https://balford.net/), a 12,000 m² precision metal forming plant in Zhuji, Zhejiang, China.

Use this toolset early in the design phase to answer the questions that decide tooling cost and part quality:

- Can this cylindrical part be deep drawn in **one hit**, or does it need multi-stage tooling?
- What blank diameter do I start with, and what is the **draw ratio**?
- How much **blanking / cutting force** does the press need?
- What is the **bend allowance** for a given radius, thickness and angle?
- How much does the blank or finished part **weigh**?

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derlinnet-svg/balford.git
cd balford
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Deep drawing feasibility for a cup: OD 22 mm, height 45 mm, wall 1.2 mm
balford deep-draw --diameter 22 --height 45 --thickness 1.2

# Blanking force: perimeter 220 mm, thickness 1.5 mm, UTS 400 MPa
balford blanking-force --perimeter 220 --thickness 1.5 --uts 400

# Bend allowance: radius 2 mm, thickness 1.5 mm, 90°
balford bend-allowance --radius 2 --thickness 1.5 --angle 90

# Blank weight: area 380 mm², thickness 1.5 mm, steel
balford weight --area 380 --thickness 1.5 --material steel
```

Example output:

```text
$ balford deep-draw --diameter 22 --height 45 --thickness 1.2
Blank diameter (approx.) : 66.7 mm
Draw ratio               : 3.03
Verdict                  : multi-stage
Draw force (estimate)    : 77.3 kN
Hint                     : Requires multi-stage deep drawing tooling (redraws and possible annealing).
```

## Python API

```python
from balfordtools.deep_draw import deep_draw_check

result = deep_draw_check(diameter_mm=22, height_mm=45, thickness_mm=1.2)
print(result.blank_diameter_mm)   # ~66.7
print(result.draw_ratio)          # ~3.03
print(result.verdict)             # "multi-stage"
```

## Reference data

The tables our engineers actually look up, as files you can diff, quote or drop
into a spreadsheet. Every value is a planning figure for feasibility checks — the
limiting draw ratio of a specific material lot still has to be confirmed in
tooling tryout.

| Data | File |
|---|---|
| Limiting draw ratio (first draw + redraw) by material | [`data/limit-draw-ratios.csv`](data/limit-draw-ratios.csv) |
| Die clearance per side by material | [`data/die-clearance.csv`](data/die-clearance.csv) |
| Deep drawing defects → cause → remedy | [`data/deep-drawing-defects.csv`](data/deep-drawing-defects.csv) |
| Material designations and where they are used | [`data/deep-drawing-materials.csv`](data/deep-drawing-materials.csv) |

Written out with the formulas, the stage-count estimate and the tolerance notes:

- **[Deep drawing design guide](docs/deep-drawing-design-guide.md)** — blank diameter, draw ratio, draw force, die clearance, blank holder, ironing, defects, tolerances
- **[DFM checklist](docs/dfm-checklist.md)** — what to send with a drawing so the first quotation round is the last one

Highest-value numbers from the guide:

| Material | Typical designation | First draw ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Low carbon steel | DC04, SPHE | 1.8 – 2.0 |
| Pure iron | DT4, DT4C | 1.8 – 2.0 |
| Brass / copper | CuZn37, Cu-ETP | 1.8 – 2.2 |
| Stainless steel | 1.4301, 1.4404 | 1.6 – 1.8 |
| Aluminium | EN AW-1050, 3003, 5754 | ~1.4 – 1.6 (alloy dependent) |

## Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `balfordtools/deep_draw.py` | blank diameter, draw ratio, single vs multi-stage verdict, draw force estimate |
| `balfordtools/stamping_force.py` | blanking/cutting force, stripping force estimate |
| `balfordtools/bend_allowance.py` | K-factor bend allowance in degrees or radians |
| `balfordtools/material_weight.py` | part/blank weight from area, thickness and material density |
| `balfordtools/cli.py` | command-line entry points |

The formulas are simplified first-pass estimates used for feasibility and quoting sanity checks. Always validate critical geometries with a full DFM review, and confirm tooling decisions with experienced die engineers.

Corrections with a reference beat opinions. If a value in `data/` disagrees with
your own tryout data, open an issue with the material, thickness, tooling setup
and the measured result.
